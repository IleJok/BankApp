# BankApp

This is final project of Lappeenranta University of Technology's (LUT) object oriented programming course. Prior to this course I had no experience in Java or Android development. The aim of the project and the course is to learn design and develop programs with object oriented mindset.

Here are the main requirements (property of LUT) for this final project:

"
- Used object oriented programming
- At least five different classes & objects (graphical user interface –classes are not counted)
- Application works on some Android version 6.0 or newer
- Writing most important information to a file (XML, JSON or CSV)
- Code and commenting is in English
- Before a method short description what it does, how it does it and what it returns 
  E.g. /* This method takes the input value, translates it to a sum of ASCII values and returns it */ Self-evident things are not       necessary to comment (if method has a name getName()-you don’t have to comment that “method returns a name”)
  Inside a method, unclear parts can be commented to desribe what it does
- Good basic rule in commenting: Someone who hasn’t written the code must be able to understand what is happening in the application. - If it isn’t clear from the code, write a comment.
- If you name your variables well, it helps. But if you use i,j,k.l,a,b,c –variables, it may be difficult to understand "

Every project needs a somekind of design plan, so here is mine: https://github.com/IleJok/BankApp/blob/master/app/docs/Project%20design.pdf

And here is the documentation of my project:
